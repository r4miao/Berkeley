# Introduction

The Berkeley Highway SC-45 Corridor (BSC-45) is a narrow, roughly 450-square-mile strip of land primarily located in the northwestern corner of Berkeley County, South Carolina, with a small portion extending into neighboring Orangeburg County. Situated between Lake Marion and the Santee River wetlands to the north and Lake Moultrie to the south, the corridor faces geographic constraints that limit north-south travel. As a result, Highway SC-45 serves as the primary route for daily commuting and emergency evacuations for the area's 25,000 residents. BSC-45 includes 10 census tracts, 8 of which are identified as disadvantaged communities by the EJScreen tool. These communities grapple with a complex array of challenges, including socioeconomic vulnerability, workforce development crisis, inadequate infrastructure, high energy burden, environmental and climate hazards, and health disparities.

In terms of **socioeconomic vulnerability**, the BSC-45 corridor has a poverty rate exceeding 20%, with nearly half the population living below 150% of the federal poverty line. According to the 2020 American Community Survey (ACS), the median household income in the corridor is \$47,863, significantly lower than the national average of \$67,521. This disparity is further exacerbated by a high unemployment rate of 8%, surpassing the national average of 3.5%. The area's predominantly Black population, comprising over 45%, faces challenges in educational attainment, as only 12% of residents have a college degree, compared to the national average of 31%. These disparities contribute to a cycle of poverty and limited opportunities for residents.

The region is also experiencing a **workforce development crisis**, exacerbated by an underfunded school system. All six public schools in the area are Title I schools, with an average pupil poverty rate of 78%. The inadequate school system has imposed long-term constraints on workforce development. Among the two high schools, only 20% of students are considered college-ready. The percentages of graduates who have completed a Career and Technical Education (CTE) program and earned industry-recognized certifications are 12.5% and 8.6%, respectively. Unfortunately, the future workforce outlook is not promising, as students in the three elementary schools show little indication of improving these trends. For example, ...

The area is also suffering from **inadequate infrastructure and high energy burdens**, which further exacerbate the socioeconomic vulnerabilities of its residents. The lack of a regional resilience hub, coupled with the poor condition of public schools and residential buildings, creates a precarious environment for residents during emergencies. Three of the public schools that were designated as the public emergency shelters nevertheless were not equipped with any resilience power supply solutions or energy-efficient air filtration systems to ensure air quality for the crowded public space. Residential buildings also face challenges. Of the 2,000 housing units, nearly half are mobile homes that suffer from poor insulation and outdated utilities, leading to low energy efficiency. Moreover, high energy costs, particularly for low-income families, place an undue financial burden on households and limit their ability to access essential services. Only 30% of homes use electricity as their primary heating source, and many residents are burdened by high energy costs, with households spending more than 10% of their income on energy. For low-income families, this burden can reach as high as 20%, with over 20% of these households relying on wood for heating. The region's extreme heat, with over 80 days annually above 90 degrees, exacerbates these challenges.

In addition to economic and energy challenges, the area faces significant **environmental and climate risks**. More than 7% of the land lies within the 100-year floodplain, increasing the community's vulnerability to flooding events. Nearly 60% of the region is classified as having wildfire risk above the 90th national percentile. The community is rated high or very high in both National Risk and Social Vulnerability, while its Community Resilience Rating remains moderate to low. Particularly, this area faces very high risk of Hurricane and lightening. For instance, 11 hurricanes and 5 tropical storms were [recorded](https://www.dnr.sc.gov/climate/sco/hurricanes/#map) in the past 20 years, causing various levels of damages. Other than strong winds and precipitation from hurricanes and tropic storms, the average annualized frequency of lightening in this area exceeds 95 times/yr, posing significant threat to energy supply. Finally, several facilities in and around the area contribute to toxic air emissions, including the Holcim Holly Hill Cement Plant, CR Bard, Inc., Santee Cooper Cross Generating Station, Giant Cement Co., Dorchester Biomass LLC, and Argos Cement LLC Harleyville Cement Plant.

**Health disparities**. There is a higher-than-average prevalence of current asthma, with more than 11% of the population affected, exceeding national averages. the obesity rates range from 42% to 52% for different census tracts. The obesity rates vary between 42% and 52% across different census tracts in this area. 18% of the area's population has a disability. Finally, 75% of the area is classified as a food desert, where many households lack access to a vehicle and live more than half a mile from the nearest supermarket, or they reside more than 20 miles from the closest grocer
