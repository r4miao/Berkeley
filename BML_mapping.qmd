## Introduction

The [Berkeley Lake Moultrie (BLM) Area](./Target_map.html) is a 635-square-mile region forming a ring around Lake Moultrie, located in the remote northwestern corner of Berkeley County, South Carolina. The area is bordered by another lake and the Santee River wetlands to the north, the Francis Marion National Forest to the east, swamps and woodlands to the west, and suburban communities of the Charleston metropolitan area to the south. Geographic constraints have concentrated human settlement, economic activities, and transportation within this ring around Lake Moultrie, making the highways encircling the lake the primary routes for daily commuting and emergency evacuations for the 40,000 residents. These natural barriers on three sides, combined with the lake at the center, have resulted in the region being predominantly rural and significantly underserved.

The BLM Area consists of 26 census block groups, with half identified as disadvantaged communities by the EJScreen tool. The remaining block groups, which do not meet the disadvantaged designation, are skewed by the presence of small clusters of lake houses. These communities grapple with a complex array of mutually reinforcing challenges, including socioeconomic vulnerability, workforce development crisis, inadequate infrastructure, high energy burden, environmental and climate hazards, and health disparities.

In terms of **socioeconomic vulnerability**, the BLM area has a poverty rate exceeding 20%, with nearly half the population living below 150% of the federal poverty line. According to the 2020 American Community Survey (ACS), the median household income in the corridor is \$47,863, which is significantly lower than the national median. This income gap is compounded by a high unemployment rate of 6%.. This disparity is further exacerbated by a high unemployment rate of 6%. The area's predominantly Black population, comprising over 45%, faces challenges in educational attainment, as only 12% of residents have a college degree, compared to the national average of 31%. These disparities contribute to a cycle of poverty and limited opportunities for residents.

The region is also experiencing a **workforce development crisis**, driven by an underfunded school system. All six public schools in the area are Title I schools, serving a student population with an average pupil-in-poverty rate of 75%. The inadequate school system has imposed long-term constraints on workforce development. Among the two high schools, only 20% of students are considered college-ready and less than 40% are career-ready. Additionally, less than 11% have completed a Career and Technical Education (CTE) program or earned industry-recognized certifications. Unfortunately, the future workforce outlook is bleak, as students in the elementary and middle schools show little improvement in academic performances. For example, less than 15% of middle schoolers meet or exceed expectations in math, 22% in science, and 36% in English.

The area's low-quality workforce pipeline starkly contrasts with the burgeoning green industrial development opportunities in its immediate vicinity and in South Carolina in general. As one of the fastest-growing states, South Carolina boasts a booming green energy supply chain industry, including electric vehicle and battery manufacturing, solar panel production, and advanced materials manufacturing. A large portion of the BSC-45 corridor was designated by the Governor as the Opportunity Zone that offers aggressive tax incentives to attract businesses to create high-quality jobs. The Camp Hall Commerce Park, located on the southern border of this area, is already home to major employers like [Volvo Cars](./Volvo_location.html) and Redwood Materials, with the potential to generate thousands of high-quality jobs that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants. The Park is still actively seeking additional investors aligned with its vision of a next-generation industry park. Just thirty minutes west, a newly established Solar Panel Manufacturer further demonstrates the region's green industrial potential. As such, to address the workforce development bottleneck and capitalize on these opportunities, strategies focusing on equipping schools are essential.

Meanwhile, the region's **inadequate infrastructure and high energy burdens** pose significant resilience challenges for both the community and individual households. The lack of a regional resilience hub, coupled with the poor condition of school and residential buildings, creates a precarious environment for residents during emergencies. Despite being designated as public emergency shelters, three of the schools in the area lacked resilient power supplies and energy-efficient air filtration systems, compromising their ability to provide safe and comfortable environments during emergencies. Residential buildings also face challenges. Of a total of 12,000 housing units, nearly half are mobile homes that suffer from poor insulation and outdated utilities, leading to low energy efficiency. Moreover, high energy costs, particularly for low-income families, place an undue financial burden on households and limit their ability to access essential services. Only 30% of homes use electricity as their primary heating source, and on average a household spends more than 10% of its total income on energy. For low-income families, the energy burden can reach as high as 20%, with over 20% of these households relying on wood for heating. The region's extreme heat, with over 80 days annually above 90 degrees, exacerbates these challenges.

Additionally, the region faces a range of **environmental and climate risks** that threaten both its ecosystem and community safety. More than 7% of the land lies within the 100-year floodplain, increasing the community's vulnerability to flooding events. Nearly 60% of the region is classified as having wildfire risk above the 90^th^ national percentile. The community is rated high or very high in both National Risk and Social Vulnerability, while its Community Resilience Rating remains moderate to low. Particularly, this area faces very high risk of Hurricane and lightening. For instance, 11 hurricanes and 5 tropical storms were [recorded](https://www.dnr.sc.gov/climate/sco/hurricanes/#map) in the past 20 years, causing various levels of damages. Other than strong winds and precipitation from hurricanes and tropic storms, the average annualized frequency of lightening in this area exceeds 95 times/yr, posing significant threat to stable energy supply. Finally, several facilities in and around the area contribute to toxic air emissions, including the Holcim Holly Hill Cement Plant, CR Bard, Inc., Santee Cooper Cross Generating Station, Giant Cement Co., Dorchester Biomass LLC, and Argos Cement LLC Harleyville Cement Plant.

**Finally, Health disparities (to be finished...)**. There is a higher-than-average prevalence of current asthma, with more than 11% of the population affected, exceeding national averages. the obesity rates range from 42% to 52% for different census tracts. The obesity rates vary between 42% and 52% across different census tracts in this area. 18% of the area's population has a disability. Finally, 75% of the area is classified as a food desert, where many households lack access to a vehicle and live more than half a mile from the nearest supermarket, or they reside more than 20 miles from the closest grocer
